# My Very Top-Level Analysis

P.U.N.K. as an engine for summoning one or both of Crystron Halqifibrax or Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon made an extremely strong showing, being in upwards of 30% of decks that made the top cut. Mystic Mine was well used both in main and side decks, and Anti-Spell Fragrance seemed to be one of the best floodgates for this event.

# yugioh-topping-decks
Repository of Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game event topping decklists.

Intended to serve as a repository/database of topping decklists from the TCG. May include lists from regionals, OTS championships, YCS tournaments, national/world/continental tournaments, and possibly interesting lists from large local events.

Current planned system is to have a folder for each format, then for each event, then folders for each topping decklist, with a readme.md file that gives a short bit of context to the list, any relevant links to things like deck profile videos, and then the decklist itself, possibly with hyperlinks to yugipedia or TCGPlayer. There may also be other versions/content, such as [Duelingbook](https://www.duelingbook.com/) links/screenshots, YDK files, text files, etc, but this is not guaranteed.

Feel free to contribute decklists or other featuures by either emailing me at siakastevens4@gmail.com, or branching off this repository and making a pull request.
